## About
tt is an AI-powered CLI tool inspired by GitHub Copilot CLI.
Unlike Copilot, it doesn’t require a GitHub license — just plug in your own API key (e.g., OpenAI) and you’re ready to go.

Type natural language commands and let tt suggest and execute the appropriate terminal commands for your system.
